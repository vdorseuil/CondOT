Project by Thomas Robert, Valentin Dorseuil and Paul Janicot.
Work done under the supervision of RÃ©mi Flamary, during the course MAP588 - Emerging Topics in Machine Learning :  Optimal Transport for Machine Learning (OTML), at Ecole polytechnique.


## The project
This project 
This project uses the article from Bunne, C. about the supervised training of conditional Monge Maps and try to reproduce the experiments.

## Usage
Run the CondOT.ipynb. Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies.
