# CondOT
by Thomas Robert, Valentin Dorseuil and Paul Janicot.
Work done under the supervision of RÃ©mi Flamary, during the course MAP588 - Emerging Topics in Machine Learning :  Optimal Transport for Machine Learning (OTML), at Ecole polytechnique.

## The project
This project aims at reproducing CondOT method proposed by Bunne, C., a nouvel algorithm leveraging neural network performances to learn conditional Monge maps.

## Usage
Run the CondOT.ipynb. Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies.
